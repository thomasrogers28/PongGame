# PongGame
Recreation of the classic game pong

Game is designed to be run in Python primarily using pygame.

Current bugs:
- ball sometimes passes through the paddle 
- paddles will not move when up/down keys are held continuously 
- paddle speed is not correct yet (probably need a slower ball and quicker framerate to create a faster paddle)
- ball only bounces off the front of paddle, not the top/bottom 
- speed increases requires optimisation
